## Description

###### An Angular application written in TypeScript that allows the user to create and edit a list of the foods they have eaten, along with calories and details about each food. The user can choose to view all logged foods, only foods over 500 calories, or only foods under 500 calories.

###### This project demonstrates the following skills:
* Use of a model to organize data
* Use of components to create display and behavior for templates
* Use of TypeScript with defined data types
* Filtering models through a pipe
* Use of two-way data binding in an edit/update form
* Management of dependencies with npm and Bower
* Use of a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server, and all necessary build tasks

Please see PLANNING.md in the root level of the project folder if you would like additional details on my process in creating this project.
